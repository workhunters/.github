_Your next job might be one click away_

Is this another one of those job-listing websites, we already have 'Linkedin', 'naukri.com', 'internshala', 'indeed', 'monster.com'
, 'Angellist', 'PeerList', what was the need for this?

Well, if we are talking about Linkedin then there are a lot of jobs we agree, but they are not categorized based on the experience, and it makes difficult to identify the unique jobs that I want to apply, and if jobs are there then those jobs are not good enough.
- And it takes time to read job description and it is very **tedious work** to go check id it is right job for user or not.


### 1.<b> Example - that Jobs are not categorised based user's Experience level.</b>
